The United People's Organization and the Earth's government thank you! You're doing a great part in the war against
Kristalids. The history has many bloody wars, including recently war between Triada corporation and MSF. That war taught
us a lot, united us, developed our technologies. All disagreements that arose over the century were resolved exclusively
by peaceful means. Suddenly one of the people's expeditions have met new living beings. Unfortunately, the expedition
was destroyed by them. The last message read ''Run!'' That's people faced a new enemy are Kristalids. They push every
life form and don't contact, their technology are better than ours. Therefore, we have loses, but we believe, one day
will become day X!

A hard times came...
