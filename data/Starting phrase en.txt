A hard times came...
The United People's Organization and the Earth's government, thank you!
You're doing a great part in the war against Kristalids. The history has many
bloody wars, including recently war between Triada corporation and MSF. That
war taught us a lot, united us, developed our technologies. All disagreements
that arose over the century were resolved exclusively by peaceful means.
Suddenly one of the people's expeditions have met new living beings.
Unfortunately, the expedition was destroyed by them. The last message read
'Run!' That's people faced a new enemy are Kristalids. They push every life
form and don't contact, their technology are better than ours. Therefore, we
have loses, but we believe, one day will become day X!
