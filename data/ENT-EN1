Today is December 31st, 3199. In 2 hours it'll be 200 years since people explored their sector "Karagon" and faced
terrible creatures Kristalids. Unknown creatures destroying all inhabited systems. They came from the depths of the
space and nothing is known about them, except that they are very aggressive and try to destroy any enemy ship.
You're tired of the life on Earth and you decided to try yourself in the role of a spaceship pilot. You've never wanted
being a miserable warrior or a helpless merchant, let alone vile pirates, scaring innocent people.
A year ago you tried to create your own pilot union "Rangers" free people, undepending on anyone. You thought this idea
will been liked to many people, but, unfortunately, the corrupt politics of the Earth didn't allow you to do this. So,
the last year you were full drunk, but today, you've bought a new ship for the remaining money. You're full
determination to discover something new! Therefore, tomorrow you'll fly to the mercenary center to get next
instructions.
